We've called upon him several times at\r\n    very short notice, when we needed to throw together a demo, or hack up\r\n    some new features, and time was short.\r\n    \r\n    Eric always dives into our code enthusiastically, no matter how hacky\r\n    or crufty it is before a deadline.  He works hard to deliver results\r\n    on time; if he hits a wall, he finds a way around it.\r\n    \r\n    In a startup, deadlines can be stressful and tempers can sometimes run\r\n    high; Eric's cheerfulness and relentless positivity avoids escalating\r\n    any situation.\r\n    \r\n    All in all, Eric is a great developer and a great guy.  I wouldn't\r\n    recommend you hire him though, because we found him first.\r\n    \r\n     -- James Boyden, CEO, SnapDisco\r\n\r\n#### From a client for whom I built:\r\n- JSON API that connects to a payment processor as well as allowing users to access their proprietary technology.\r\n- Android Application in Python\r\n\r\n## What Did I Study?\r\n### Bachelor of Commerce and Software Engineering (Honours), 2008-2013\r\n#### University of Sydney\r\n\r\n- Software Engineering Units I have studied that involved programming:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    COMP  2007  Algorithms and Complexity\r\n    COMP  2129  Operating Systems and Machine Principles  \r\n    COMP  3308  Introduction to Artificial Intelligence\r\n    COMP  3615  Software Development Project  \r\n    COMP  5046  Statistical Natural Language Processing\r\n    COMP  5348  Enterprise Scale Software Architecture\r\n    ELEC  1601  Foundations of Computer Systems\r\n    ELEC  3609  Internet Software Platforms\r\n    ELEC  4712  Honours Thesis A\r\n    ELEC  4713  Honours Thesis B\r\n    ELEC  5619  Object Oriented Application Frameworks  \r\n    INFO  1103  Introduction to Programming\r\n    INFO  1105  Data Structures\r\n    INFO  2120  Database Systems 1\r\n    INFO  3220  Object Oriented Design\r\n```\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n- I achieved in the above courses \"Distinction\" or above.\r\n\r\n## Where To Find Me?\r\n\r\n- [Github](http://github.com/meric)\r\n- [Email me](mailto:meric.au+github@gmail.com)",
